# tic_tac_toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses. The game can be played through the live link.

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

## Live link
https://tictactoe-111.netlify.app/


## Skills
    HTML5
    CSS3
    JAVASCRIPT    

## Copy code
    git clone https://github.com/soubhik-111/tic_tac_toe.git
    cd tic_tac_toe
    
Then, check it or modify it:


./tic-tac-toe
The game will prompt you to choose whether you want to play as X or O. The player who goes first is X, and the player who goes second is O.

To make a move, enter the row and column where you want to place your piece (for example, "1 3" to place a piece in the top right corner of the board). The game will update the board and announce the winner if the game is over, or it will prompt the next player to make a move.

That's it! You're now ready to play Tic Tac Toe. Have fun!
